# :office: my-online-resume

I was extremely lazy to always make minor changes to resume and then reupload it to drive everytime. Hence, I over-engineered it  ðŸ¥². 

### :thinking: What am I doing??

I am building a new resume everytime I make a small change and commit to this repo using github workflows to build <i>(originally my resume was in latex so I need to build it to get my resume in pdf form)</i> the resume for me. And then used github page to actually host that pdf file as a static file without any hassel at all.

### :smirk: What are the benefits??

Now, I dont need to re-upload my resume to drive after every single update and always my updated resume would be at same URL so yeah cool.

### :rocket: Feel free to use my workflow to automate your personal resumes
